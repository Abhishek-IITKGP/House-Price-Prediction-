# House-Price-Prediction-

# Overview

Welcome to the House Price Prediction project! This project aims to explore and analyze a dataset to predict house prices using Python and various data analysis and machine learning libraries. The project involves several steps, including data loading, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, feature selection, model training, and evaluation. This README file will guide you through each step of the project to help you understand the process and the code implemented in the project.

# Introduction <a name="introduction"></a>

The goal of this project is to predict house prices based on various features of the houses. We will use Python programming language and popular data analysis libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and machine learning library Scikit-learn to achieve this objective.
# Data <a name="data"></a>

The dataset for this project consists of two CSV files: "train.csv" and "test.csv". The "train.csv" file contains the training data with features and target variable (SalePrice), while the "test.csv" file contains test data for which we will make predictions. We will use Pandas library to load and handle the data.
Dataset is downloaded from Kaggle- https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/data
# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) <a name="eda"></a>

EDA is an essential step in any data analysis project. In this step, we will explore the dataset, visualize the data, and identify any missing values. We will use Matplotlib and Seaborn libraries to create visualizations that will help us understand the relationships between features and the target variable.
# Feature Engineering <a name="feature-engineering"></a>

Feature engineering involves preprocessing and transforming features to improve the performance of machine learning models. In this step, we will handle missing values, convert non-Gaussian features into Gaussian features using log transformation, and deal with rare categorical variables.
# Feature Selection <a name="feature-selection"></a>

Feature selection is crucial to select the most relevant features that contribute significantly to the target variable. We will use Lasso regularization technique for feature selection, which helps us identify the most important features for our model.
# Model Training and Evaluation <a name="model-training-and-evaluation"></a>

For this project, we will use RandomForestRegressor as our machine learning model. We will use GridSearchCV to perform hyperparameter tuning to find the best parameters for our model. After training the model on the training data, we will evaluate its performance using the test data. We will use the R-squared and adjusted R-squared metrics to assess the model's performance.
# Conclusion <a name="conclusion"></a>

In this project, we have gone through the entire process of building a house price prediction model. We have explored the dataset, performed feature engineering and selection, and trained a RandomForestRegressor model to make predictions. The model's performance has been evaluated using test data, and the R-squared and adjusted R-squared metrics have been used to assess its performance.
